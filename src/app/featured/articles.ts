        body: "NOAA Fisheries has awarded more than $2.4 million to partners around the country to support innovative bycatch reduction research projects through its Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program. Bycatch of various species--fish, marine mammals, or turtles--can have significant biological, economic, and social impacts. Preventing and reducing bycatch is a shared goal of fisheries managers, the fishing industry, and the environmental community. Working side-by-side with fishermen on their boats, NOAA Fisheries has developed solutions to some of the top bycatch challenges facing our nation's fisheries. Ongoing regional projects include: Creation of an enhanced communication network and real-time maps to allow longfin squid fishermen to avoid butterfish \"hot spots\" and reduce bycatch by 54 percent in the Northeast. Development of a modified gill-net in the Mid-Atlantic that reduced sturgeon interactions by 64 percent in Virginia's striped bass fishery. Use of LED lights on the West Coast to reduce endangered Columbia River smelt bycatch in the ocean shrimp trawl fishery by 91 percent. 2016 Award Recipients The newly-awarded projects support bycatch reduction research around the country and address a variety of species, including Chinook salmon, Pacific rockfish, shrimp, swordfish, halibut, coastal sharks, skates, sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals."

        topic: "Protected Resources",
        body: "Resident populations of Hawaiian spinner dolphins feed offshore throughout the night and return to Hawaii's coasts to rest during the day. Because Hawaiian spinner dolphins rest in Hawaii's sheltered bays and along its coastlines and are one of the most easily encountered cetaceans in the waters of the Main Hawaiian Islands, they are vulnerable to disturbance and harassment. Dolphin-directed activities have grown dramatically in recent years, and the easily accessible Hawaiian spinner dolphins face heavy and increasing pressures from people seeking a dolphin experience. Chronic disturbance to resting activities can negatively affect the health and fitness of dolphins. NOAA Fisheries is proposing to enhance protections for Hawaiian spinner dolphins to prevent disturbance and harassment from dolphin-directed human activities. The proposed rule would prohibit swimming with and approaching a Hawaiian spinner dolphin within 50 yards by any means (vessel, person, or other object) and would be implemented within two nautical miles from shore of the Main Hawaiian Islands and in designated waters between Maui, Lanai, and Kahoolawe where spinner dolphins are found throughout the day. The proposed rule is based on the preferred alternative (Alternative 3A) in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Other alternatives considered include the following:"

        body: `Based between Los Angeles and San Diego, Eric Chavez works to conserve fish habitat in Southern California. In this Q&A, he discusses his role as a Marine Habitat Resource Specialist with NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Regional Office in Long Beach, California.

This year is the 20th anniversary of Essential Fish Habitat. Why should we be excited?
It’s exciting to look at where we were, where we are, and where we’re going. These types of anniversaries are a good time to take stock of what you’ve done and evaluate whether or not we’ve made progress. And we certainly have.

Although we have plenty of challenges ahead, including effects from climate change and invasive species, we’re gaining new information and technology to tackle them. We also have motivated, informed stakeholders involved, and essential fish habitat (EFH) is a great tool to bring those people together and work towards solutions.

What is your role as a marine habitat resource specialist?
One of my primary roles is conducting EFH consultations. During the EFH consultation process, NOAA Fisheries staff works with federal agencies to help them reduce the adverse effects of their actions on habitat for federally managed fisheries. We consult on a wide spectrum of coastal and marine activities, ranging from large military projects and port development projects down to individual dock construction.

For instance, I’ve consulted with the Navy on large scale military exercises, where their actions might have a number of different impacts on EFH. The Navy agreed to map the habitat within the area ahead of time to identify sensitive habitats and then incorporate those data into their procedures to avoid impacts. The Navy also agreed to identify specific zones for their exercises and mitigate for impacts within those zones.

I’m also engaged in various groups that further habitat conservation efforts outside the EFH consultation process. For instance, I’m a long-time member of the Port of San Diego Environmental Advisory Committee, a diverse group committed to protecting and improving the environmental conditions of the San Diego Bay by enacting a number of efforts, including fishery inventories, research projects, and environmentally preferable hull paint alternatives development.

        title: "Action Plan for Fish Release Mortality Science",
        date: "Autumn 2016",

        topic: "Science and Technology",
        body: `
        NOAA Fisheries recently finalized the Action Plan for Fish Release Mortality Science. This plan identifies the best practices for estimating and reducing discard and release mortality for fish in commercial and recreational fisheries.

Discard and release mortality occurs when fish or other animals are caught alive and then die after release. Severe injury or predation, such as being eaten at the water's surface after release, can cause immediate death. Stress or injury during capture or handling can leave a fish unable to find or digest food effectively, resulting in death at a later time. 

The Action Plan is part of NOAA Fisheries’ proactive approach to addressing bycatch in U.S. fisheries. Bycatch occurs when fishing operations discard fish, cause unobserved mortality, or interact with living marine resources such as marine mammals, seabirds, corals, sponges, sea turtles, or protected fish. Although U.S. fisheries are among the world’s most sustainable, bycatch is a complex, global issue that threatens the sustainability and resiliency of our fishing communities, economies, and ocean ecosystems.  

The U.S. is a leader in responsibly managed fisheries. We are committed to minimizing bycatch in our fisheries to ensure that they remain sustainable. Forty years of management under the Magnuson-Steven Act (MSA) has been successful and has demonstrated that a dynamic, science-based management process is fundamental for maintaining sustainable fisheries. As part of our efforts to address bycatch, NOAA Fisheries and its partners created this Action Plan as well as a simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) tool. Together, the Action Plan and SMART tool: 

SMART tool

Help identify fish that would benefit most from improved mortality rate estimates.

        title: "From farm to your table, oysters offer a sustainable choice",
        date: "Summer 2016",

        topic: "Aquaculture",

        Kari Eckdahl is currently spending a year as a California Sea Grant Fellow working in NOAA Fisheries’ California Aquaculture Program Office. The California Sea Grant State Fellows Program matches highly qualified graduate students with host agencies in the state. She shares her observations in this column.

My time as a Sea Grant Fellow with NOAA Fisheries’ California Aquaculture Program Office has opened my eyes to the role that marine aquaculture can play in providing a healthy, sustainable source of food, and what NOAA Fisheries is doing to promote it.

You may have heard of “Farm to Table” in terms of vegetables, but there’s a similar concept in shellfish aquaculture. Oyster farms deliver fresh, healthy, protein-packed oysters to your table, and the popularity of their products is growing. The value of oyster production in Washington, Oregon and California has doubled in the last 15 years, hitting a record high of almost $63 million in 2014, the last year with data available.

That makes oysters one of the most valuable shellfish on the West Coast, important both to the economy and to the people who love to eat them.

As part of my NOAA fellowship, I learned a lot that surprised me. Did you know that more than 95% of oysters consumed worldwide are farmed? That is a good thing when it comes to local oysters. NOAA Fisheries’ FishWatch rates oysters a smart seafood choice because they are sustainably farmed and harvested under U.S. and state regulations.

I saw this for myself during a tour of Hog Island Oyster Farm, owned and operated by John Finger and Terry Sawyer, in Tomales Bay in Northern California. They explained that farms usually get “seed” oysters from hatcheries when they are about 2 millimeters in size and then place them in a bay either in floating mesh bags or an apparatus called a FLUPSY (FLoating UPwelling SYstem).

A FLUPSY looks like a barge, and is up to about 100 feet long with walkways down the center and sides. Between the walkways a row of bins hangs down into the water and holds the oysters. A large paddlewheel at each end of the bins forces nutrient-rich water towards the oysters.

Once the oysters reach about ¼-inch in size, the farm moves them into larger cages or bags where they continue to grow. Depending on the species, an oyster can take one to three years to reach harvest size.

The tour showed me what makes oyster farming so sustainable. Oysters do not require feed or fresh water. Oysters are filter feeders so they eat the microscopic algae and nutrients already suspended in seawater. An oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water in a day and actually help improve water quality of bays by filtering out excess nutrients and sediments.

Since oysters continually filter water within the bay, farmers are particularly concerned about water quality. Oysters cannot be harvested and sold from bays that contain harmful chemicals, bacteria, or phytoplankton species that cause Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).

This is one area where NOAA Fisheries provides support for oyster farmers. For example, NOAA Fisheries scientists are developing an early warning system for HABs using an Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). An ESP, also called a “lab in a can,” can collect and analyze water samples in a bay in real-time. The ESP uses DNA technology to detect harmful algae and bacteria in the water. It can then relay the data to farmers via radio, satellite, or even their cell phone.

Scientists are hoping to couple the ESP with weather forecasts to provide farmers advance warning of red tides in the future. The idea is that with enough notice, farmers can pull their oysters out of the water before a bloom occurs, preventing a substantial economic loss.

As a fellow in the NOAA Fisheries Aquaculture Program located in the Sacramento office, I have a hand in helping guide shellfish farmers who are navigating the regulatory permitting process, and in providing them access to science resources such as the ESP.

The Hog Island tour ended fittingly with shucking and eating oysters while gazing out on Tomales Bay. Prior to starting this fellowship I had probably only eaten about a handful of oysters in my life. Since February, I have eaten dozens of oysters. It makes me feel good to know I am eating something healthy, sustainable, local, and delicious!
